## Introduction

Formula language is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a wide range of calculations in spreadsheets, calculators, and other applications. Formulas can be used to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers; perform mathematical functions such as trigonometry and calculus; and manipulate text strings.

## Syntax

Formula language uses a simple syntax that is easy to learn. A formula expression typically consists of operands, operators, and functions. Operands are the values that the formula operates on, such as numbers, text strings, and dates. Operators are symbols that indicate the operation to be performed, such as +, -, *, and /. Functions are predefined formulas that perform specific tasks, such as calculating the average of a group of numbers or finding the square root of a number.

**Examples**

Here are some examples of simple formula expressions:

* `1 + 2`
* `(10 - 5) * 2`

The first formula expression adds the numbers 1 and 2 together and returns the result, 3. The second formula expression subtracts 5 from 10 and then multiplies the result by 2, returning the result, 10. The third formula expression calculates the sine of pi divided by 2 and returns the result, 1. The fourth formula expression calculates the logarithm of 10 and returns the result, 1. The fifth formula expression calculates the average of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and returns the result, 3.

## Functions

Formula language includes a library of built-in functions that can be used to perform a wide range of tasks. Some of the most common functions include:

SUM(): Calculates the sum of a group of numbers.
AVERAGE(): Calculates the average of a group of numbers.
COUNT(): Counts the number of cells in a range that contain data.
IF(): Evaluates a logical expression and returns one value if the expression is true and another value if the expression is false.
VLOOKUP(): Looks up a value in a table and returns the corresponding value from another column in the table.
For a complete list of built-in functions in formula language, please consult the documentation for your specific application.

## Error handling

Formula language can handle errors gracefully. For example, if a formula expression contains an invalid operand or a function that is not supported, formula language will return an error message.

## Conclusion

Formula language is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a wide range of calculations in spreadsheets, calculators, and other applications. Formula language is easy to learn and use, and it includes a library of built-in functions that can be used to perform a variety of tasks.
